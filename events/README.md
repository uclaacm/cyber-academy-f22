# Events
Follow the format of the ```example/events.toml``` file to create an event!

## Event Creation
Each event should correspond to a directory within the `events/` directory. Make sure to include an ```icon.svg``` within every event folder!

Regarding `event.toml`, follow this [example](https://github.com/uclaacm/cyber-academy-s22/blob/main/events/boba-run/event.toml).
