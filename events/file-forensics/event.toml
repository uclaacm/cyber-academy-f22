description = """Ever wondered what *really* goes on inside files?? 🤔🧐 We might know they’re all full of 01001100’s or whatever, but those have to mean something! Come join Cyber as we first take a look at what a file really is (⁉️) and then jump into disassembling files and learning how to be a 🕵️ file detective. See the traces left behind in your “digital footprint” and how data can be hidden in seemingly plain sight! Pull up to the File Forensics workshop for all this fun *and* to see our handsome faces 😉 (2 in 1!!)
